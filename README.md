# earley-parser

An implementation of an Earley parser in Java

At this point, this is a very simple implementation of the Ealrley parser algorithm itself, incorporating various enhancements and optimizations to the original algorithm itself. 

However, the implementation itself has been written without paying any attention to the actual algorithmic complexity constraints, so the actual performance of this implementation may be far below the optimal.

At this point this is just an exploration of the Earley parsing and all of the techniques to improve the complexity characteristics of the parser itself.
 
First milestone of this implementation should be a functionally correct Earley parser.

Second milestone is
